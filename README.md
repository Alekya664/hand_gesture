##Hand-Gesture

This project detects the hand movements and through the finger movements it tells the total number of fingers that are used to make a gesture.
It is an machine learning project where we used a Douglas-Peucker algorithm to approximate the contour with a polygon. This algorithm is useful for simplifying complex contours while preserving their essential shape.
